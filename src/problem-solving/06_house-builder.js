/**
 * Your function should print a house according to the following specification
 *
 * Param 1: height
 * Param 2: width
 * If width is not provided width = height
 *
 * Doors:
 * A door is always 3 fields wide and min 2 and max 3 field high.
 * It is always on the bottom center of the house and always has at least 1 free row above.
 * If it does not fit into the house, there is no door.
 *
 * Windows:
 * There is either (a) no window (not enough space in the house) or (b) two windows in the house.
 * Each window has a size of 3x3.
 * They always have the same distance from each other as from the left and right wall of the house.
 * If the math does not work out the adjustment is done in the center between both windows.
 * Vertically they are always in the center between the top of the door and the bottom of the roof.
 *
 * We rather have a door in the house, then windows.
 *
 * Please implement it generic, not just to fulfill the test.
 * See the test to find the charakters to use and to answer your questions.
